            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>We are Josep, Jordi and Mateu, students in QA testing and programming.</p>
            <h2>What is TRIVIA API</h2>
            <p>Trivia API is a QA testing studies final project, using different programming languages to let you access to 
                <a href="https://opentdb.com/" class="linkAU">API Open Trivia Database</a>. This API is free to use and meant
                for projects for students like us. </p>
            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>How it works?</h3>
            <p>To access to the trivia questions you can from the home page or directly from our header. You just need to click
                <a href="./triviaGame.html" class="linkAU">Trivia</a>
            </p>
            <h3>What are the categories?</h3>
            <p>In our API, you can choose between 24 categories, including movies, history and nature! Just choose one of these
                on the list and play!</p>
            <h3>Which are the difficulty levels?</h3>
            <p>You can choose between three different levels of difficulty: easy, medium and hard. The questions will be curated
                according to these difficulties, and if you don't choose any, you will receive from all difficulties.</p>

            <h3>The question doesn't appear, what is the problem?</h3>
            <p>We are dependent on an external database to get our questions and answers. If this page is down, its impossible
                for the API to access these. You can access the status of OpenTDB in 
                <a href="https://isitdownorjustme.net/status/opentdb-com/" class="linkAU">this page</a></p>
            <h3>Can I access to the Github page?</h3>
            <p>In <a href="https://github.com/Holoturia/Trivia-API" class="linkAU">our page </a> you can see our code and the inner workings of the page, along with the technical and user manuals.</p>
